- I’m @703337
- I’m interested in a lot of things, including coding in HTML, CSS and JS.
- as of 2024 I am taking NCEA Level 3 and am starting to fully remake LS Game *again* using what I'm learning this year.
- I say again because I was starting to last year and then had to abandon it due to school and other commitments, so hopefully I'll be able to work on this one more.
